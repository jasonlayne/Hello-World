Had a dream last night. About my high school days and my youth in general. All those let downs and failures and loneliness showed up in figures from that time. The truth is that I grew up lonely and confused. I saw things in my own way and didn't run with the crowd and yet I was craving acceptance. Now in the warm light of the seasons I realize that I just couldn't have it both ways, that there is a price to paid for each choice. There were many good times as well. The long days and nights roaming a deserted beach, lost weekends into the hills, making music, writing, and so much more. So dear so-called friends and lovers from the past may your journey be as amazing as mine has been. I chose the the road less taken and I am the better man for it. May you have the same good fortune. And if fortune and fate deems that I walk my journey on my own so be it. I have no regrets.
